short: Checks that the gradle wrapper Actioj is installed
desc: Checks that the gradle wrapper Actioj is installed
motivation: >
  The gradle wrapper (see https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) is required to build with gradle.
  Even though the wrapper is a binary and binaries should be avoided (see BinaryGradleNotPresent rule), there is a list of "known" official binaries.
  So a maintainer can commit the wrapper to their repository so long as they have a safe way to verify that the file
  is one of the official binaries.
implementation: >
 The rule checks that the repository has configured the 'gradle/wrapper-validation-action' Action from https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action.
outcome:
  - If the 'gradle/wrapper-validation-action' is installed, the rule returns OutcomePositive (1).
  - If the Action is not installed, the rule returns OutcomeNegative (0).
risk: High
remediation:
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Install the 'gradle/wrapper-validation-action' Action by following the instructions in https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action.
  markdown:
    - Install the [gradle/wrapper-validation-action](https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action) on the repository.
