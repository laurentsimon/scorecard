short: Check that the project is fuzzed using OSS-Fuzz
desc: This rule checks that whether the project is fuzzed with OSS-Fuzz
motivation: >
  TODO(https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/2657): fuzzing catches bugs. For go, can be logic bug, null pointer accesses, DoS attacks.
implementation: >
 The implementation looks for a file called ".clusterfuzzlite/Dockerfile".
outcome:
  - If the file is found, one finding with OutcomePositive (1) is returned.
  - If the file is not found, one finding with OutcomeNegative (0) is returned.
risk: Medium
remediation:
  effort: High
  text:
    - Follow the steps in https://github.com/google/clusterfuzzlite to integrate fuzzing as part of CI.
    - Over time, try to add fuzzing for more functionalities of your project.
