short: Check that the project is fuzzed using Go native fuzzing framework
desc: This rule checks that whether the project is fuzzed with the Go native fuzzing framework
motivation: >
  TODO(https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/2657): fuzzing catches bugs. For go, can be logic bug, null pointer accesses, DoS attacks.
implementation: >
 The implementation checks whether some .go files contains functions with the signature 'func FuzzSomeName(*testing.F)'.
outcome:
  - If one or more fuzzing functions are found in the source code, a finding with OutcomePositive (1) is returned.
  - If no fuzzing functions are found in the source code, a finding with OutcomeNegative (0) is returned.
risk: Medium
remediation:
  effort: High
  text:
    - Follow the steps in https://go.dev/doc/fuzz/ to enable fuzzing on your project.
    - Over time, try to add fuzzing for more functionalities of your project.
