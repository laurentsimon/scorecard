short: Check that the project is fuzzed using OSS-Fuzz
desc: This rule checks that whether the project is fuzzed with OSS-Fuzz
motivation: >
  TODO: fuzzing catches bugs. For go, can be logic bug, null pointer accesses, DoS attacks.
implementation: >
 The implementation lists the projects integrated with OSS-Fuzz in https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects,
 and checks whether the project is in the list.
outcome:
  - If an integration with OSS-Fuzz is found, the rule returns OutcomePositive (1).
  - If no integration with OSS-Fuzz is found, the rule returns OutcomeNegative (0).
risk: High
remediation:
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Follow the steps in https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz to integrate fuzzing for your project.
    - Over time, try to add fuzzing for more functionalities of your project.
