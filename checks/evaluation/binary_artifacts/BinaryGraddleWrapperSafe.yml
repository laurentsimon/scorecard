short: Checks that graddle wrappers are safely managed
desc: This rule checks that graddle wrappers are safely managed if they are present
motivation: >
  TODO: copy BinaryArtifactsNotPresent rule or link to it?
  The graddle wrapper (see https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) is required to build with graddle.
  Even though the wrapper is a binary and binaries shuold be avoided (see BinaryArtifactsNotPresent rule), there is a list of "known" official binaries maintained by X.
  So a maintainer can commit the wrapper to their repository so long as they have a safe way to verify that the wrapper
  is one of the official binaries.

implementation: >
  The rule is implemented by first searching for files with the name 'gradle-wrapper.jar'. If one or more files are found,
  the rule checks that the repository has configured the 'gradle/wrapper-validation-action' Action from https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action.
risk: High
remediation:
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Install the 'gradle/wrapper-validation-action' Action by following the instructions in https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action.
  markdown:
    - Install the [gradle/wrapper-validation-action](https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action) on the repository.
