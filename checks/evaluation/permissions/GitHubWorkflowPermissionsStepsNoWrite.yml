short: Checks that GitHub workflows do not have steps with dangerous write permissions
desc: This rule checks that GitHub workflows do not have steps with dangerous write permissions
motivation: >
  Even with permissions default set to read, some scopes having write permissions in their steps brings incurs a risk to the project.
  By giving write permission to the Actions you call in jobs, external Action you call could abuse them - deendencin on the permissions, this could let them
  commit unreviewed code, remove pre-submit checks to introduce a bug, etc.
  For more information about the scopes and the vulnerabilities involved, see https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions.

implementation: >
  The rule is implemented by checking whether the `permissions` keyword is given non-write permissions for the following
  scopes: `statuses`, `checks`, `security-events`, `deployments`, `contents`, `packages`, `actions`.
  Write permissions given to recognized packaging actions or commands are allowed and are considered an acceptable risk.
risk: Medium
remediation:
  effort: High
