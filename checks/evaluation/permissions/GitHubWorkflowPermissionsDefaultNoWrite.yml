short: Checks that GitHub workflows do not have default write permissions
desc: This rule checks that GitHub workflows do not have default write permissions.
motivation: >
  If no permissions are declared, a workflow's GitHub token's permissions default to write for all scopes.
  This include write permissions to push to the repository, to read encrypted secrets, etc.
  For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token. 
implementation: >
  The rule is implemented by checking whether the `permissions` keyword is defined at the top of the workflow,
  and that no write permissions are given.
